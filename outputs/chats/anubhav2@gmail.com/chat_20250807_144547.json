It outlines a phased approach, starting with aggregating existing content into a specialized Quality Measures pane, then creating an organization review process for trusted organizations. It also considers adding domain-specific metadata and enabling dataset comparison features. The document emphasizes the importance of data selection and the need for standardized metadata. It also highlights the dependency between HDX and data owners for assessing data fitness for purpose."
